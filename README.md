# Customer API

## API First Development
An API-first approach assumes the design and development of an application programming interface (API) comes before the implementation. Your team begins by creating an interface for their application. After the API has been developed, the team will rely on this interface to build the rest of the application.

## Swagger OpenAPI Specification
The *OpenAPI Specification (OAS)* defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
